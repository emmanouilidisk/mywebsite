I am a 1st-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science of Johns Hopkins University (JHU) advised by Professor [Nicolas Loizou](nicolasloizou.github.io) and [Rene Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html) .

My research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical computer science with machine learning and optimization, focusing on providing algorithms with theoretical guarantees for the large-scale machine learning regime.

Before coming to the States, I worked with Professor [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) and [Pavlos Efraimidis](https://euclid.ee.duth.gr/) on the field of opinion dynamics. I got my joint BSc - MSc from Democritus University of Thrace (DUTh).
