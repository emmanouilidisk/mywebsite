I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University (JHU),   
being co-advised by Professor Nicolas Loizou and Professor Rene Vidal. I am interested in algorithms for machine learning and optimization, having as a higher goal to provide theoretical guarantees that ensure the reliable and succesful use of algorithms in the large scale paradigm. To do this, I enjoy combining my diverse research interests covering: theoretical computer science, optimization, machine learning and game theory.

Prior, I worked with Professor [Dimitris Fotakis] (https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) and Professor [Pavlos Efraimidis] (https://euclid.ee.duth.gr/) on the intersection of theoretical computer science and the field of opinion dynamics. I recieved a joint BSc - MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Greece.   

You can find my CV [here](static/files/cv.pdf).
